        <p align="justify">
            Greetings! I am <strong>The_Spanish_Bread</strong>. I am a student of Saint Louis University with the major of Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.
             I am currently on my 5th and the last year of my term. My time in the University let me earn a great deal of knowledge and values, especially 
             in dealing with my own share of life struggles and mental health. And of course, I have my own great deal and knowledge with Electrical Engineering
             and its science.
            <br><br>
            While I have my own share of knowledge relevant to my
            degree, I also aspire to be a Web Developer with knowledge on both Front-end and Back-end development. I have chosen <strong>"The Odin Project"</strong> for its beginner friendly platform
            and linear type progression.
            As of now, I'm learning basic git commands, linux commands
            and basic HTML.As soon as I have  considered I am confident enough with HTML and building the basic web-page structures, I will move on to improving its design, or
            applying CSS. Until I have reached my goal of being a fully-stacked developer. But my journey will not stop there of course. Because there will always be room for 
            improvement throughout.
            <br><br>
            At the same time, I also have plans to start drawing pixel-art, or at least improve at it. Here are some of my illustrations, its not much since I am still new and have
            no prior artistic art skill at all.

            <br><br>
            Why the sudden rush of learning different profession or skills you may ask? Well, growing up I really never special talent or so, and spent a great deal of time with video-games
            instead. Growing up, I've considered that video games won't do me anything good in the long run. I need a hobby that will earn me usefull skill and profession. I have chosen Web
            Development, while squeezing that prior HTML prior knowledge from high-school and very small MATLAB knowledge from university, for its flexibilty to yield designs,functions and 
            animations capability that users are able to view straight from their browser, quite similar to what its like whenever I create Powerpoint presentations.
            <br><br>
            That's about it! Thank you for checking out my first Web Development project!
